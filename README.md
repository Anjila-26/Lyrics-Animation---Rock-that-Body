## Features

## How It Works
- **lyrics.txt**: Contains the lyrics to be displayed, one line per lyric.
- **main.html**: The main web page. Loads the lyrics and sets up the display area.
- **script.js**: Reads the lyrics file, splits it into lines, and animates each line on the screen.
- **animations/**: Contains CSS and image assets for visual effects.
- **font/**: Custom font files for styling the lyrics.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this folder.
2. Open `main.html` in your browser.
3. Watch the lyrics animate! You can edit `lyrics.txt` to use any song you like.

## Customization
- **Change the lyrics**: Replace the contents of `lyrics.txt` with your own song.
- **Change the font**: Add your own font files to the `font/` folder and update the CSS in `main.html`.
- **Edit animations**: Modify or add new effects in the `animations/` folder and update the CSS/JS as needed.
